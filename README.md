    <b>Abstract:</b><br>
    In this project, I analyzed a 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings">
      Kaggle dataset 
    </a>
    on expert ratings for over 1,000 different <br>
    chocolate bars available in the market. The dataset includes information on cocoa percentage, <br>
    company location, bean type and origin, ratings, and other relevant details. <br>
    I grouped the companies by their continent based on location and categorized the bean origins. <br>
    To assess whether the effects of company location, bean origin, and cocoa percentage on the <br>
    ratings were significant, I conducted ANOVA and Chi-squared tests. <br>
    Additionally, I investigated the relationships among the various features. <br>
